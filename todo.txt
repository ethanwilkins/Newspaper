#### Todo list ####

1. Have sub tabs apear in the feed along side posts.

7. Zip code issue http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5180185








Step 1: Find the density value

User provided zip code = 5 digit number, Ex. zip code: 27610

Zip_code = 27610 ***** Enter this value into the system wide zipcode data base, save each user zip provided *****

ZipRadius = 10  // this is the value that we can change but will ultimately be the “absolute, static, no changing” value //

ZipRangeBottom = zip_code - ZipRadius 

zipRangeTop = zip_code + ZipRadius

density_range = ZiprangeBotom…to..ZipRangeTop

DataBaseCheck: at this point, check how many zip codes in the data base fall with in this range
Return: The value of the number of zipcodes in the data base that fall with in the density_range
this numerical value will be the “Density_Value” Density_Value determines the minimum and maximum
amount of zip_codes in their area to access, cutting off the zip codes that are farthest away,
the ones most different in numerical value, takes each zip code as a string of characters, and
adds weight to the similarity of the first few characters, less weight to characters at the end
of the string of numbers that match each other



Step 2 : flip the density value

Density_Value = // some number between the 1 and two times the
ZipRadius added to the Zip_Code to derive the ZipRangeBotom and ZipRangeTop. //

{
	x = 1
	y = 2 * ZipRadius
	If Density_Value = x
	then Fliped_Density_Value = y
	not x++, y--
}
//Run this logical statement till it resolves to true

I still have not come up with good values for the actual bullets for the “slider in the
network size option” but ideally we will just take the Fliped_Densit_Value and multiply
the bulleted value to create a range of zipcodes









#### DONE ####

maybe through a dedicated controller or even a model for submitting
a record containing the english and spanish version for each control
A form for submitting each word perhaps
done

9. How are we going to go about the Spanish implementation?
done

10. Is there a way that we can delete the tabs so as to be able to avoid duplicates in the future?
done

11. How is the ability to clear the game boards of game cards. We could also just make them expire every month.
done

8. More tab
done

2. Special accounts for business to post on to special tabs: This means that we would be able to provide a business with a code that they code then use to create said special account which would allow them to post thing to special tabs. Example: Bob’s Burgers creates an account with the code 555666. Which would allow them to post their special to the site on a tab called local  special which only users with business accounts could post to.
done

3. We need a button to let the user access their account.
done

4. Proper procedure for posting youtube videos?
done

5. Have two fields that allow users to input a thread in both English and Spanish so that based on the user’s preference they either get the English or Spanish version of a post if either or is available.
done

6. Have a button that a user can have their post submitted to an admin for translation to Spanish. This way English business can create a post and have it converted to Spanish at the push of a button. The post would of course go to an admin for translation and then once completed he post would go on to where ever they were going.
